# Cognitive-Robotics
Final year group studies project

My main contribution to a group studies project studying cognitive robotics. The aim of the project was to use machine learning to optimise a motor control task in a Nao humanoid robot. To do this I researched and implemented the NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmented Topologies) using TensorFlow in Python, applying the final method to increasingly complex simulation environments. 

The files included in this project show my NEAT implementation using ANNs generated by TensorFlow. The provided simulation environments for testing are OpenAI's 'CartPole' and 'BipedalWalker' Gym environments. To run the test first run 'Construct_Network_NEAT.py' (containing subroutines to translate NEAT gene information into TensorFlow neural networks) before running 'NEAT.py'.

Necessary modules:
- numpy
- tensorflow
- gym
- keras
